<h3>How does GRAIN#5400 work?</h3>
<b>Deposit your MPT tokens</b>
<br>This strategic Kompounder takes in the mLQDR+LQDR MPT liqudity tokens as deposits, comprised of LQDR & mLQDR in a stable-pool. This Granary issues the "GRAIN#5400", a standard yield-bearning token, proportionally to all the investors that invest in it.
<br><br>
<b>Let us use your MORPH reward</b>
<br>All of the collateral rasied is continuously staked at the MorpheusSwap's Neo Farm to earn MORPH. Simultaneously, it also taps the Liquid Driver's Reward-Sharing, Gauge & Bribe rewards, rewarding us with WFTM tokens consolidated by mLQDR's exposure to xLQDR for generating additional income. When at work, this Granary first harvests all MORPH from the MorpheusSwap's Neo Farm, which it converts to PILL at the going rate of the Pills Dispenser. These PILLS are then sold to earn more FTM via Guru Network's own special JIT "Just-in-Time" Psuedo Dex-aggregation protocol, routing it via Legacy SpiritSwap DEX & MorpheusSwap, both, to get the best Rates!
<br><br>
<b>And use those Pirate treasures..</b>
<br>Next up, it revisits Neo to procure its share of Liquid Driver's Revenues, Bribes & Gauge incentives, which are already morphed into to FTM by now -- Thanks, Morpheus! Now the Granary turns to the Sea, and market-buys more LQDR, yet again tapping into our Kompound Protocol's own Dex-Aggreation sub-protocol, scouting across the new Solildy-based V2 DEX of SpiritSwap and the Musical Hills of Beethoven-x. This enhances capital efficiency to Elite-tier optimization.
<br><br>
<b>The Red Pill? Or the Blue Pill?</b>
<br>Like Neo, the Granary must now choose: The Red Pill? Or the Blue Pill?
<br>Owing to its Elitist upbringing, the Granary knows how to make the best of both Choices. It refers to Morpheus's Oracle to judge the peg of mLQDR against LQDR.
<br><br>
<b>The Red PILL /TRP</b>
<br>If mLQDR is trading under the Peg, it chooses the to gulp the Red Pill, attempt to restore the Peg back to 1. To this effort, it injects its LQDR, single-sided, into the liquidity pool - but is smart enough to only add as much needed to restore the peg. All Excess is split Right in Two, with one half being wrapped into mLQDR, and then paired with its twin in a 1:1 ratio to mint the MPT Liquidity Tokens.
<br><br>
<b>The BLUE Pill /TBP</b>
<br>In case the mighty Oracle of the Matrix tells our Granary that mLQDR is trading above the peg at the markets, our clever Granary sets out to reap an Arbitrage profit - For the benefit of its investors. It goes all out with its LQDR to mint brand new mLQDR wrappers. Then it pushes them all into the Pool to mint more than 1 unit per token MPTs, to realise the arbitrage profit via a Solo Joint into MorpheusSwap's "Pirates in The Matrix" Vault. Meanwhile, it does it with the utmost sophistication, being careful to not push the Price Ratio under 1:1 :: mLQDR:LQDR. It precisely only arbs as much as needed to bring the price back to precisely 1.0 and whatever assets get left behind are converted into exact 50% + 50% of mLQDR + LQDR, and then that surplus is merged using the Balancer's flagship "Proportional Join" concept.
<br><br>
<b>Welcome back to Reality</b>
<br>Finally (before going to the holographic bed?), the Granary dispatches its earnings of the day, The MPT of the Pirates in The Matrix, back to the trustworthy Morpheus for a re-deposit into the Neo Pool.
<br><br> And in this way when Neo wakes up again, the GRAIN tokens are worth more MPT than the previous morning, thanks to the magic workers of Kompounding!

<h2>General Information</h2><br>
<h4>Get MPT-mLQDR-LQDR</h4>
<a class="fore" href="https://beets.fi" target="_blank">Add LQDR with mLQDR to liquidity at Morpheus Dex.</a>
<br><br>Utilizes The Pirates in the Matrix pool: Stableswap pair between mLQDR & LQDR.
<br>
<br>If 1 LQDR is worth MORE than 1 mLQDR, then add ONLY LQDR to the Pool using a single-sided join.
<br>If 1 LQDR is worth LESS than 1 mLQDR, then add ONLY mLQDR to the Pool using a single-sided join.
<br>If its trading at 1:1, then mint new mLQDR with EXACT HALF of your LQDR holdings and add the other HALF of LQDR with the minted mLQDR in a 1:1 (50%-50%) proportional to the Liquidity.
<br><br>
<h4>Advantages of Kompounders (Granaries)</h4>
Compounding yield requires transaction fees to be paid to the blockchain. This can add up quickly to be expensive and cut into returns. As we batch your transaction with many other depositor's transactions, it brings about a cumulatively lower cost and higher return to earn yield using the Kompounder (Granary).
<br><br>
<i>For a new user, 13 transactions need to be made to make their first farm yield compound : Buy token P, Buy token Q, Approve token P, Approve token Q, Add P-Q Liquidity, Approve Farm for P-Q LP, Deposit P-Q LP tokens, Harvest yield token R, Approve yielded token R, Sell token R for P, Sell token R for Q, Add P-Q Liquidity and finally Deposit the gained P-Q LP tokens! For subsequent compounds, a user needs to make 5 transactions everytime they wish to compound.</i>
<br><br>
Kompounders (Granaries) free our users from this burden of manually sending dozens of transactions RINGly and save their effort, time and precious KCS & FTM! This results in a compounded yield, which is greater than simple farming.
<br><br>
<h4>Frequency of Compounding</h4>
Farms are compounded either on deposits or on withdrawals made into the Kompounder (Granary). Compounding also occurs when a user ("Worker") does work by pressing the "Start Working" button and successfully completing the resulting transaction. It is as important to not compound too early as it is to compound too late.
<br><br>
<h4 id="eliteness">What is Eliteness?</h4>
Holding ELITE tokens on Fantom Opera Blockchain determines the <i><b>Eliteness Level</b></i> of an address. For example, holding 0.1 ELITE grants the user an Eliteness level of 0.1, which changes with their ELITE holdings. A certain minimum amount of Eliteness is required to gain special privileges or advantages while using some of our Dapps. Eliteness is measured at the run-time of blockchain and fellow Smart Contracts that build atop ftm.guru require the same Eliteness Level as normal users.
<br>This GRAIN#5400 has no minimum Eliteness requirements.
<br><br>
<h4>Wages for the Workers (Incentives)</h4>
Compounding transactions are complex smart contract functions which cost the worker a small amount of KCS or FTM as a "gas fee". To compensate the workers for their hardwork, we reward them with a share in the AUM of the Kompounder (Granary), equivalent to 1% of the value harvested from the underlying farm. This share grows inside the Kompounder (Granary) in value on its own if left unattended by the Worker.
<br><br>
<h4>Fees and taxes</h4>
There is No withdrawal fee at all. Generally, there is No deposit fee if your Eliteness Level is <b>above 0.01</b>, otherwise there is a 0.1% tax. 1% from the harvest is paid to the workers and 1% from the harvest is added to the E.L.I.T.E. D.A.O. treasury for promotional programs & the upkeep of this platform. These 2% are charged only on gains harvested and not on principal amount of investments.
<br><br>FEE UPDATE:
<br><b>THERE IS A FIXED 0.1% DEPOSIT FEE for GRAIN#5400.
<br>A 1% Performance fee is taken on the harvested yield (not on principal funds).
<br>Workers are paid 1% of the harvested yield. Anyone can be a worker and earn this reward.</b>
<br><br>
<h4>KP & GRAINS - Protocol Receipt tokens</h4>
Upon each deposit, including worker payouts, the Kompounder (Granary) issues special tokens called KP (GRAIN) tokens that represent a user's share in the AUM of the specific Kompounder (Granary). These are standard ERC20 compliant tokens that can be used freely elsewhere on the blockchains. Withdrawing funds without possesing them is not possible. Please dont give these to strangers.
